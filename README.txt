Fire Emblem Heroes Summon Simulator by Henry Zheng (@H4nriZ)

[Instructions]
To add a new banner to the simulator...
1. Create a new folder with the banner's name within the "Banners" folder.

2. Create a new text file called "Heroes.txt" within that new folder.

3. Add the summonable heroes (seperated by commas, no spaces!) from that banner to "Heroes.txt" 
in the following format (one list per line):

	3a. red focus heroes  
	3b. red five-star heroes
	3c. red four-star heroes
	3d. red three-star heroes 
	3e. blue focus heroes  
	3f. blue five-star heroes
	3g. blue four-star heroes
	3h. blue three-star heroes 
	3i. green focus heroes  
	3j. green five-star heroes
	3k. green four-star heroes
	3l. green three-star heroes 
	3m. colorless focus heroes  
	3n. colorless five-star heroes
	3o. colorless four-star heroes
	3p. colorless three-star heroes 

If a list doesn't contain any heroes, enter "None" on its line.

4. Import the banner's image into its folder and name it "Banner Image.png". The recommended
size for the image is 425x308.

5. Add the banner's name to a new line in "Banners.txt".

6. If applicable, import icons for new heroes (downloaded from fireemblem.gamepress.gg).

[TODO/Potential Future Updates]
- Automatically move scroll bar to bottom of the "Summons" window's scroll pane
- Add ability to set summoning priorities in terms of colors
- Add list of all summoned heroes and their quantities sorted by color and then by rarity
